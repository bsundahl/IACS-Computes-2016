    "At it's most basic level, a function is something that accepts inputs, and produces outputs. Think of a function as a factory. It takes some number of raw ingredients, and spits out a finished product or products. We can give functions names just like we give variables names. The inputs that a function works with are normally written in parentheses after the name of the function. So let's say we have a function named f that takes 2 inputs, which we'll temporarily call a and b. Then we write f(a,b). f takes a and b and produces something. Let's say it produces one thing and let's call it c. Then we can write f(a,b) = c."
